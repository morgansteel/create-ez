# create-ez #
Create PT in 8 lines. Took me 5 minutes, and I don't even know Python!

## Proof that all the requirements are met ##

The Create PT requires that the code contain the following:

- A list (Line 1)
- A procedure (Declared on Line 2)
- A call to the procedure (Called on Line 8)
- Selection (an `if` statement is present on Line 5)
- Iteration (`for name in nameList` on Line 4)

## Could this be truncated more? ##

This is the shortest program I could get in Python that meets all the requirements in traditional snake case. Condensing it to one line doesn't count.
